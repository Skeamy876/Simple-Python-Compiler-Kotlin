# Kotlin-Python Compiler
This project aims to build a simple compiler written in Kotlin that can compile Python code. Currently, the project includes a basic implementation of a lexer with error handling to process Python code into tokens.

### Project Status
The project is in the early stages of development. The current implementation focuses on:

- Lexer: A lexer that breaks down Python code into recognizable tokens.
Error Handling: Basic error handling to capture and report issues in the lexical analysis phase.

### Future Goals
- Parser: Create a parser to analyze the syntactic structure of tokenized input.
- Semantic Analysis: Implement semantic checks to validate code meaning.
- Code Generation: Develop functionality to compile valid Python code into executable formats or intermediate representations.
- Optimization: Optimize the compiler's performance and error detection capabilities.

## Requirements
- Kotlin: This compiler is built with Kotlin and requires a compatible Kotlin runtime.
